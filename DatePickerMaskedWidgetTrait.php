/*
 * Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such as PHP.
 * A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance by enabling a developer
 * to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies.
 * The semantics of the combination of Traits and classes is defined in a way which reduces complexity,
 * and avoids the typical problems associated with multiple inheritance and Mixins.
 * A Trait is similar to a class, but only intended to group functionality in a fine-grained and consistent way.
 * It is not possible to instantiate a Trait on its own. It is an addition to traditional inheritance and
 * enables horizontal composition of behavior; that is, the application of class members without requiring inheritance.
